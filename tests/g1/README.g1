This directory contains an example for the calculation of the g1 function
It corresponds to the data in Fig. 2 of T. Bardon-Brun et al, Phys. Rev. Research 2, 013297 (2020)
The input file is in params_g1_2d.dat and it can be ran with:
  python compute_prop.py params_g1_2d.dat
(where you have to put the proper path for the script compute_prop,py, something like ../../prop/compute_prop.py)
The wallclock time is 12.5s on my desktop computer. 
As this example averages over 8 disorder realizations, it can also be ran with MPI:
  mpiexec -n N python compute_prop.py params_g1_2d.dat
with N the number of processes.
The system size and the final time are slightly smaller than in the original figure, and the
spatial discretization a bit too large, but the results are nevertheless good.
To compare with the original figure, distances have to be multiplied by 0.158 and times divided by 2.
g1 is computed at t=0, 100 and 200, which corresponds to z/zNL=0, 50, 100.
You may view the 2d plot of (real part of) g1 using:
  view_2d.py g1_intermediate_N.dat
with N=0, 1 or 2.
You may compute an angular average using
  my_extract_radial.py g1_intermediate_N.dat
and looking at the 1d data in g1_intermediate_N_Re_radial.dat

N.B.: In this example, there is no disorder, the randomness is only in the initial state which is
of type "gaussian_with_speckle".
